# Project Name

Week 5 project was creating a guess-who game. Super fun and learnt a lot.
The game is about guessing a secret character based on options in the select menu indicating the characterstics of the game characters in the game board . When a particular characterstic of the person is selected it is filtered out/kept, based on if it matches the secret person. If you are confident about your choice you can guess the person directly from the game board.
I customised the game by minimising the guesses to maximum of five attempts, once five attempts are done, the player must make a choice and select a character.

## The problem

It was hard but leant a lot about how to invoke functions, add properties to a function etc.
Learnt how to customise alerts using sweetalerts.
learnt about math.random function.
